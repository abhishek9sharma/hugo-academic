# Biography,

Hey!

I am currently a Research Fellow at [LARC, Singapore](https://larc.smu.edu.sg/). Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in Information Systems from [School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University](https://sis.smu.edu.sg/) where I was supervised by Associate Professor [David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/). My Ph.D. thesis, titled *Social Software Development: Insights and Solutions*, focused on finding insights about [content](files/preprints/icsme15-twitter.pdf) produced by developers on Twitter, addressing the issue of [information overload](files/preprints/nirmalSANER2015.pdf) faced by them, proposing automated techniques for finding [relevant technical urls](files/preprints/URL.pdf), and classifying [domain relevant experts](files/preprints/tosem18preprint.pdf) on [Twitter](https://leif.me/2013/11/how-software-developers-use-twitter/). <!--The techniques developed may aso be useful in solving similar problems in other [media channels](https://leif.me/2016/08/more-than-just-coding-a-study-on-supportive-channels-and-activities-in-software-development/) used by software developers.-->


I am a native of  [Himachal Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh), a small Himalayan state in India and have been born and brought up there till my graduation in 2008 from  [National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur](http://nith.ac.in/). My hobbies include watching and playing football and [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/18520965) occasionally.

<!--I have submitted my Ph.D. thesis, titled *Social Software Development: Insights and Solutions*, for the final evaluation. -->
<!--I was a part of the [SOAR group](https://soarsmu.github.io/)-->
<!-- ##### I am open to new oppurtunities. If you are interested in knowing more about me and my work please do contact me.  -->
