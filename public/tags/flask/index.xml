      <description>Many times I have to search for repositories at GitHub which may fill a coding requirment I have. During this process I have realized that I also go on looking at the forked versions of a repository in order to find something that matches my exact requirment. This app helps me with this process by automatically fetching the forks of a given repository and listing how far or behind they are from the parent fork.</description>

      <description>This is an example of a web service which exposes the data in a google big-query table as a web service. Currently it provides 3 endpoints which help to query data present in the NYC Taxi Dataset. You can find the source code of the application here. A demo has been deployed at nyxtaxiservice.
Note: On live demo at nyxtaxiservice there are currently some issues with the endpoint avg_fare_by_s2id</description>
