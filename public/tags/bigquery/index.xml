      <description>This is an example of a web service which exposes the data in a google big-query table as a web service. Currently it provides 3 endpoints which help to query data present in the NYC Taxi Dataset. You can find the source code of the application here. A demo has been deployed at nyxtaxiservice.
Note: On live demo at nyxtaxiservice there are currently some issues with endpoints avg_fare_by_s2id and avg_speed_24hrs_for_date</description>
