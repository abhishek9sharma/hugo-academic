Twitter is also one of the popular social mediums used by developers. A recent study by Singer et al. found that software developers use Twitter to “keep up with the fast-paced development landscape”. Unfortunately, due to the general purpose nature of Twitter, it’s challenging for developers to use Twitter for their development activities. Our survey with 36 developers who use Twitter in their development activities highlights that developers are interested in following specialized software gurus who share relevant technical tweets. To help developers perform this task, in this work we propose a recommendation system to identify specialized software gurus. Our approach first extracts different kinds of features that characterize a Twitter user and then employs a two-stage classification approach to generate a discriminative model, which can differentiate specialized software gurus in a particular domain from other Twitter users that generate domainrelated tweets (aka domain-related Twitter users). We have investigated the effectiveness of our approach in finding specialized software gurus for four different domains (JavaScript, Android, Python, and Linux) on a dataset of 86,824 Twitter users who generate 5,517,878 tweets over one month. Our approach can differentiate specialized software experts from other domain-related Twitter users with an F-measure of up to 0.820. Compared with existing Twitter domain expert recommendation approaches, our proposed approach can outperform their F-measure by at least 7.63%.","tags":["TOSEM","2018"],"title":"Recommending Who to Follow in the Software Engineering Twitter Space","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536422400,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Yuan Tian","Ferdian Thung","**Abhishek Sharma**","David Lo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510329600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510329600,"objectID":"b98029c3e61d20a20ebf03fe07928a45","permalink":"/publication/apibot/","publishdate":"2017-11-11T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/apibot/","section":"publication","summary":"As the carrier of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) knowledge, API documentation plays a crucial role in how developers learn and use an API. It is also a valuable information resource for answering API-related questions, especially when developers cannot find reliable answers to their questions online/offline. However, finding answers to API-related questions from API documentation might not be easy because one may have to manually go through multiple pages before reaching the relevant page, and then read and understand the information inside the relevant page to figure out the answers. To deal with this challenge, we develop APIBot, a bot that can answer API questions given API documentation as an input. APIBot is built on top of SiriusQA, the QA system from Sirius, a state of the art intelligent personal assistant. To make SiriusQA work well under software engineering scenario, we make several modifications over SiriusQA by injecting domain specific knowledge. We evaluate APIBot on 92 API questions, answers of which are known to be present in Java 8 documentation.

Personality reflects differences among people in behaviour patterns, communication, cognition and emotion. It often impacts relationships and collaborative work, and software engineering teamwork is no exception. Some personalities are more likely to click while others to clash. A number of studies have investigated the relationship between personality and collaborative work success. However, most of them are done in a laboratory setting, do not involve professionals, or consider non software engineering tasks. Additionally, they only answer a limited set of questions, and many other questions remain open.To enrich the existing body of work, we study professionals working on real software projects, answering a new set of research questions that assess linkages between project manager personality and team personality composition and project success. In particular, our study investigates 28 recently completed software projects, which contain a total of 346 professionals, in 2 large IT companies. We asked project members to do a DISC (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Compliant) personality test, and correlated the test outcomes with project success scores measured in six different dimensions. The scores were given by managers of three office as part of their regular day-to-day work. Our results show that project teams with dominant managers, along with those with more influential members and less dominant members, have higher success scores. This work provides new insights to construct a personality matching strategy that can contribute to building an effective project team.","tags":["ICSME","2017"],"title":"Personality and Project Success: Insights from a Large-Scale Study with Professionals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Abhishek Sharma**","Ferdian Thung","Pavneet Singh Kochhar","Agus Sulistya","David Lo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1497456000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497456000,"objectID":"4cc177b9cf67066aa950adcd518ade66","permalink":"/publication/cataloging/","publishdate":"2017-06-15T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cataloging/","section":"publication","summary":"GitHub is one of the largest and most popular repository hosting service today, having about 14 million users and more than 54 million repositories as of March 2017.

We propose that such cataloging should not be limited only to popular projects. We explore the possibility of developing such cataloging system by automatically extracting functionality descriptive text segments from readme files of GitHub repositories. These descriptions are then input to LDA-GA, a state-of-the-art topic modeling algorithm, to identify categories.

However, identifying relevant and useful articles among the millions of pieces of information shared on Twitter is a non-trivial task. In this work to support serendipitous discovery of relevant and informative resources to support developer learning, we propose an unsupervised and a supervised approach to find and rank URLs (which point to web resources) harvested from Twitter based on their informativeness and relevance to a domain of interest. We propose 14 features to characterize each URL by considering contents of webpage pointed by it, contents and popularity of tweets mentioning it, and the popularity of users who shared the URL on Twitter.

Often, timestamps or information about when certain instances or events occurred can provide us with critical information to recognize temporal patterns. Unfortunately, most existing techniques are not able to fully extract useful temporal information based on the time (especially at different resolutions of time). They miss out on 3 crucial factors: (i) they do not distinguish between timestamp features (which have cyclical or periodic properties) and ordinary features; (ii) they are not able to detect patterns exhibited at different resolutions of time (e.g. different patterns at the annual level, and at the monthly level); and (iii) they are not able to relate different features (e.g. multimodal features) of instances with different temporal properties (e.g. while predicting stock prices, stock fundamentals may have annual patterns, and at the same time factors like peer stock prices and global markets may exhibit daily patterns). To solve these issues, we offer a novel multiple-kernel learning view and develop Temporal Kernel Descriptors which utilize Kernel functions to comprehensively detect temporal patterns by deriving relationship of instances with the time features. We automatically learn the optimal kernel function, and hence the optimal temporal similarity between two instances. We formulate the optimization as a Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) problem. We empirically evaluate its performance by solving the optimization using Online MKL","tags":["SDM","2016"],"title":"Temporal kernel descriptors for learning with time-sensitive patterns?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Abhishek Sharma**","Yuan Tian","David Lo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443628800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443628800,"objectID":"8214e75c1e8b295491f8128501540006","permalink":"/publication/twitterevents/","publishdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/twitterevents/","section":"publication","summary":"Twitter is a popular means to disseminate information and currently more than 300 million people are using it actively. Software engineers are no exception; Singer et al. have shown that many developers use Twitter to stay current with recent technological trends. At various time points, many users are posting microblogs (i.e., tweets) about the same topic in Twitter. We refer to this reasonably large set of topically-coherent microblogs in the Twitter space made at a particular point in time as an event. In this work, we perform an exploratory study on software engineering related events in Twitter. We collect a large set of Twitter messages over a period of 8 months that are made by 79,768 Twitter users and filter them by five programming language keywords. We then run a state-of-the-art Twitter event detection algorithm borrowed from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain. Next, using the open coding procedure, we manually analyze 1,000 events that are identified by the NLP tool, and create eleven categories of events (10 main categories + “others”). We find that external resource sharing, technical discussion, and software product updates are the “hottest” categories. These findings shed light on hot topics in Twitter that are interesting to many people and they provide guidance to future Twitter analytics studies that develop automated solutions to help users find fresh, relevant, and interesting pieces of information from Twitter stream to keep developers up-to-date with recent trends.","tags":["ICSME","2015"],"title":"What's Hot in Software Engineering Twitter Space?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Abhishek Sharma**","Yuan Tian","David Lo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1426348800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1426348800,"objectID":"e0ebf5aaa078d3acb84989d6f1b00406","permalink":"/publication/nirmal/","publishdate":"2015-03-15T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/nirmal/","section":"publication","summary":"Twitter is one of the most widely used social media platforms today. It enables users to share and view short 140-character messages called “tweets”. About 284 million active users generate close to 500 million tweets per day. Such rapid generation of user generated content in large magnitudes results in the problem of information overload. Users who are interested in information related to a particular domain have limited means to filter out irrelevant tweets and tend to get lost in the huge amount of data they encounter. A recent study by Singer et al. found that software developers use Twitter to stay aware of industry trends, to learn from others, and to network with other developers. However, Singer et al. also reported that developers often find Twitter streams to contain too much noise which is a barrier to the adoption of Twitter. In this paper, to help developers cope with noise, we propose a novel approach named NIRMAL, which automatically identifies software relevant tweets from a collection or stream of tweets. Our approach is based on language modeling which learns a statistical model based on a training corpus (i.e., set of documents). We make use of a subset of posts from StackOverflow, a programming question and answer site, as a training corpus to learn a language model. A corpus of tweets was then used to test the effectiveness of the trained language model. The tweets were sorted based on the rank the model assigned to each of the individual tweets. The top 200 tweets were then manually analyzed to verify whether they are software related or not, and then an accuracy score was calculated. The results show that decent accuracy scores can be achieved by various variants of NIRMAL, which indicates that NIRMAL can effectively identify software related tweets from a huge corpus of tweets.","tags":["SANER","2015"],"title":"Nirmal: Automatic identification of software relevant tweets leveraging language model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"fd74d3ab6c31894031912915faa45e6c","permalink":"/project/ease/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ease/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
